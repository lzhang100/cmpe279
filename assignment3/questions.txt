1. The file could still be open as long as you open a file descriptor for that file before you do chroot.
2. We created an argv list to pass into execvp where the first argument is the server2 object file name, then the socket file descriptor, and finally the open file descriptor.
3. If the file size of the disk file execeedes the size of the client's hardcoded buffer, an overflow buffer could
occur and an attacker can use this as an advantage to do ROP. No the client does not have sufficient checks to ensure the no buffer over run occur.
